# Advanced-Lane-Lines
Udacity SDC Nanodegree Project 4

In this project, I found acceptable thresholds upon which to detect lane lines from an image, gave it binary activation, transformed the image to a bird's eye like view, calculated the curvature of the lane lines, and drew back on the lane lines detected onto the image. The output video was the re-drawn lines, along with the car's position with respect to the center of the lane, and the curvature of the lane.
